Estimate of Work Hours: 40 hours

We came at this number using the Lines of Code approach. We decided that we would add around 800 - 1000 new lines of code for Project 2.                     
To add 25 lines per hour seemed reasonable, and we knew that not every line would take the same amount of time, so we took into account
the research and Googling that would go behind it as well. That brings us to 36 hours of just coding and researching, and the remaining 
4 hours would be spent meeting up over Zoom or in person to work on the project together.
